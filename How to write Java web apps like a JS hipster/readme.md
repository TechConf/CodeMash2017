# How to write Java web apps like a JS hipster
### Stephen Shary
> It’s easy to find a web-developer position at an enterprise company and spend multiple years writing code in a language that was bleeding edge 10 years ago. Passionate developers go home and continually spend time learning new languages and writing in new styles that allow them to stay up-to-date. Not everyone is up for that lifestyle and the daily grind can be miserable when you’re limited on technology choices. This session focuses on the changes that have been made in the past couple of years to allow Java to go through a “renewal” so that developers now have the ability to write code that is so similar to modern Javascript server applications. It will demonstrate how Java8, Spring Boot, AsyncIO allow developers to write code in a modern way that is concise, fast, scalable and just as “cool” as the startup in the loft downtown.
