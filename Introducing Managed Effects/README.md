# Introducing Managed Effects to your Enterprise Front-ends

### Kofi Gumbs


Effect management sounds like an abstract paradigm with few tangible benefits,
so many dismiss it out of hand.
That is a mistake.

Managed effects are natural extensions of common design patterns.
It emphasizes separation of business logic
and implementation details on a whole new level.

This may sound like a big change,
but it is easy to adopt effect management in incremental steps:
no re-writes required!

Using Elm as an example,
the speaker will explore the observable benefits
that managed effects can have on your project.
You will walk away with a new appreciation for the paradigm
and the knowledge required to start implementing it today.
