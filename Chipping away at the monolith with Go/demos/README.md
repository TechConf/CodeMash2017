# Resources for "Chipping Away at the Monolith with Go"
Items in this repository are a companion to the talk "Chipping Away at the Monolith with Go" that was given at CodeMash 2017 on January 12, 2017 at 9:15 AM at the Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, OH.

## Demo Code
All of the programs can be run by going into the directory and issuing the following command: `go run main.go`  

In this repo there are two directories that contain source code:  
  - `go-kit/` - A simple Go Kit service that demonstrates the basics of using Go Kit. The service listens on localhost:8080.
  - `interfaces/` - A simple program that demonstrates how to use interfaces and demonstrates the usefulness of compatible interfaces.
  - `server/` - A simple program that demonstrates how to create a simple HTTP server that returns "Hello, World" when accessed.
