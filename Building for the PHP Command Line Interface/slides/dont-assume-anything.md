### Don't assume anything!

* Your script could be run on a wide variety of systems
* Check that system commands work before calling them <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

This could mean system libraries, PHP extensions, or other dependencies.

PHP can run in a lot of environments, so you can never be too careful!
