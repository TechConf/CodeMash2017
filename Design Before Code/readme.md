In web development, accessibility (i.e. making sure people with disabilities can use your site) is often thought of as a technical challenge which can be overcome by teaching developers to use proper semantic elements and well-placed ARIA attributes. In practice, making a site or application accessible usually involves a developer hacking away at the code (and the design) until all of the automated tests pass. If you start with a design that takes the needs of people with disabilities into account, much less time and effort will be needed to make the finished product accessible. This session will include an overview of accessible design principles and will give some practical tips for designers (and for the developers who work with them).
